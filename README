cbgrepper
	search for stuff and open it quickly in your favorite editor
	
REQUIRES
* Mac
* Applescript
* TextWrangler (optional- you can set the default editor in the script)

ABOUT

The purpose of this little script is to make it
easier to find little tidbits of information
faster than manually searching through files...
... or even just using grep alone.

Once you find the line/file you want, the script will open
it up in the text editor of your choice.

In the configuration section of the script, tell the script
where you keep your notes.*

		* since it searches recursively, you could set
		it to / or ~ if you wanted to... but I wouldn't
		
WHAT IT DOES

When you run the script, it will ask you what to search.
I haven't figured out how to deal with spaces, so for now
you can only search single words. Oh well..

Then it will return all the results, numbered.
To open the file the result comes from, type the number
and hit enter.
	
WHY

I do tech support over the phone, and each day I create a
new text document for that day's notes. I take a ton of notes,
and often I need to look up something from my notes but I
don't know which file to look in.

I wrote this script so with a few commands I can find what I'm
looking for and view it/edit it in my favorite editor.
